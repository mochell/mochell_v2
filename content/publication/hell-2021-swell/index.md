  caption: "Wave growth under a moving storm with Gaussian wind. The gray shading shows the wind forcing and the dashed gray line marks the 95%-boundary of the Gaussian wind forcing. The colored lines are characteristic curves of wave generation in the reference system of moving extra-tropical storm. Wave growth starts with a young sea from rest and a small peak group speed. It develops into a growing sea that travels at the speed of the storm, until the wind forcing retires in an old sea such that the sea state eventually stops growing and the nonlinear wave-growth terms decay. Once the wave energy in each frequency band is dominantly linear the wave energy disperses and travel as linear sea, that is, swell."
