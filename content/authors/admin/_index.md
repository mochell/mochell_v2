I am currently a PostDoc at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society with [Chris Horvat](http://www.chrv.at) and [Baylor Fox-Kemper](http://www.geo.brown.edu/research/Fox-Kemper/). I graduated from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu) (SIO) and ETH Zuerich.

I am interested in air-sea exchange and how it links to the large-scale climate variabilty. I study how surface wave generation and how they interact with sea ice. I am for better climate models without losing complexity.

I use paradigms from Geophysical Fluid Dynamics and merge them with data to probabilisitc models of proceses at the air-sea interface.

I have a graphic design and typography background and implement these rules for scientific graphics and visualization in my publications an other visualiations for science journals.
