The mid-latitude large-scale circulation drives weather patterns. However, it is not well understood how global warming phenomena, like Arctic Amplification, Stratospheric Vortex breakdowns, or changes in atmospheric moisture impact the mid-latitude zonal flow and subsequent extremes. In my work, I use idealized circulation models and QGPV-theory to develop an understanding of future extreme weather.
