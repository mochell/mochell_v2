Surface gravity waves are an important part of air-sea coupling. They alter momentum transfer across the air-sea boundary mediate stress that drives the ocean circulation and fluxes of CO2 and heat between atmosphere and ocean. In this context, I focus on how synoptic-scale variability influences Air-Sea exchange by making waves and inducing upper ocean turbulence. I combine simple models of surface wave generation with optimization methods to apply them to ensembles of wave observations.
