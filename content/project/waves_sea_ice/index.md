Surface waves impact the evolution of sea ice. Waves can break up, disperse or drift sea ice and alter air-sea heat fluxes within the sea ice. Waves play a major role in globally retreating sea ice, but the interaction is poorly understood. In my work, I use satellite and in situ observations to better understand how waves surface waves behave in sea ice.
